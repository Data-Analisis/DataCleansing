DataCleansing
=============

This Repro was created to store the Course project script called run_analysis, This script has all the comments included, below is a brief summary of the script

## The following steps are performed in the script
*Set working directory, this line will only need changing depending on the environment you are working with
*Read the file into one big data frame
*Convert the labels from numbers to factors
*limit the columns which are visibile (which contain mean/std)
*Replace shorthand words for the actual words
*Generate new data set which has all variabls aggregated- i have made the assumption this data set is diffrent from the first Data   set, this could be incorrect however the ambiguity of the exercise made me choose this apporach as meaning the mean at the time seemed redundant.
